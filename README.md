# PathPlanning-GeneticAlgorithm
My project titled 'Global Path Planning Optimization for Mobile Robot Navigation Using Genetic Algorithm' was a submission for the course ECE 750: T33 Artificial Life: Biology and Computation.

I thos project I surveyed the use of the Genetic Algorithm to solve path planning in mobile robot navigation. And implemented a multi-criteria optimization genetic algorithm in python and visualized the successful navigation from specified start to endpoint in a 2D environment within both static and dynamic obstacle maps.

The basic code for the genetic algorithm has been referred from [https://github.com/amirrassafi/pathplanning.] And the proposed algorithm has been built on top of this starter code. The evolutionary operators have been modified according to the assumptions made in the proposed algorithm. After importing the necessary python libraries, the main program is divided into several functional classes. Another important contribution to note is the introduction of dynamic obstacle shifting and modification of the genetic algorithm made to adapt to these changes.

The user interface for the visualization of is generated according to the steps listed in [https://linuxhint.com/use- pyqt-gui-builder/.]
